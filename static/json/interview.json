            "question": "Have you ever wanted to know more about your principal? We asked, so you don't have to!",
            "response": "As you may know, Ms. Sullivan has quite the history with Classical Magnet. She used to be a history teacher before being promoted to principal. We asked her which job she preferred. She said, “I think that the hardest thing right now for me, is like I'm kind of overseeing and supervising the whole school as opposed to being in a classroom with 22 students who you get to know really well. I feel like that relationship between the teacher and the students in the classroom everyday is so powerful, so I definitely miss being in the classroom, but I also love the fact that some of the work I do can impact a whole school. Hello, Gladiators! I am your principal, Ms. Sullivan. My favorite color is blue, all different shades. My favorite food is spicy buffalo wings. Extra crispy, extra saucy, and extra spicy. I love to travel, cook, and hang out with family! I would describe myself as caring and fun. I’m not a favorites person, my taste varies depending on the topic. My favorite music genres are reggae, R&B, and indie. I love the people I work with. Students, teachers, parents. I like meeting different types of students with all different interests, I just appreciate the fact that I get to work in a school building with all these people I can build relationships with.”"
