            <h1 class="poetry"> A Cruel World </h1>
            <p class="poetry"> I will change this cruel world <br/>
A world where black and whites will be equals <br/>
A place with a blue sky and peaceful winds <br/>
Not an unequal place where My color sinks. <br/>
I must protect my people against these evil Things.<br/>
Risking my life to achieve better things.<br/>
I will change this cruel world<br/>
Once again my brothers and sisters have fallen<br/>
Like a apple from a tree just like they are rotting<br/>
Six feet deep,Going by Iola, I will let the world see<br/>
You tried to reassert your power by bringing harm to me<br/>
I will change this cruel world<br/>
You were all enraged and more livid than ever,<br/>
Yet Still I Had the heart to bring more Pressure,<br/>
Proving that if we competed We will end up<br/>
In the sky<br/>
I did it on my own by risking my life<br/>
fleeing to NYC shine a brighter light and there I was proving my point<br/>
I will change this cruel world<br/>
The red record was the open gate, Bringing the<br/>
World in to see this messed up place<br/>
Traveling Around exploring well,Waging a tireless struggle<br/>
Felt like i have been stuck in hell<br/>
inequality and injustice In a place like the south is seen when my<br/>
Race falls down.<br/>
