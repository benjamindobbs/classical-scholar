          <v-card-title> A New Season </v-card-title>

            It’s beginning to grow colder, but in the best way possible. <br />
            Observing the environment in its slight blue hue, <br />
            I inhale through my nose. <br />
            There must be a cookout somewhere. <br />
            The smell of food is faint, but enough for me to wonder what they’re
            cooking. <br />
            Past the music playing in my ears, <br />
            Birds chirp in the distance, <br />
            Cars zoom up the street, <br />
            And trees shake their leaves around me. <br />
            They’re beginning to turn yellow now, <br />
            In comparison to only a week ago where the trees were green and
            full. <br />
            As the days go by, less and less leaves are on the trees. <br />
            Now they’re strolling on the sidewalk, <br />
            Tangled in the grass, <br />
            Loafing in the street, <br />
            Peering over from the roof of houses, <br />
            And resting on stationary cars. <br />
            Everywhere except where they used to be in the summer. <br />
            Normally change makes me anxious, <br />
            Yet, this change has always made me feel calm. <br />
            It’s refreshing and peaceful…<br />
            But seriously, who’s cooking?
