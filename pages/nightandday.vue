           At first there was just darkness, forced to walk alone in an endless sadness. <br>
For ages Darkness was alone, never really content with himself.<br>
However, unbeknownst to Darkness, there was another.<br>
Light was in a lonely world as well, forced to be happy with nothing to keep him grateful.<br>
One day they`re worlds collided.<br>
Very quickly, hate started to grow.<br>
A cycle was formed.<br>
Light would come out and Darkness would ruin his happiness with sadness.<br>
Light tried to deter this from happening by running around the world as quickly as possible to hide from Darkness.<br>
But Darkness would always find her.<br>
This game excited Darkness.<br>
When Light asked why Darkness would not leave him alone, Light was told that “Misery likes company.”<br>
Darkness was not lying, for every time he would see Light running around acting all happy like, Darkness got envious.<br>
The only thing that could quench this thirst for happiness that Darkness always seemed to have, was ruining Light`s happiness.<br>
However, with the collision of worlds came other emotions slowly given over time.<br>
Darkness was given guilt, jealousy, and contempt.<br>
Light got compassion, love, and relief.<br>
So, when Light`s happiness was ruined, Darkness started to not feel as good.<br>
Darkness started to feel guilty about his actions.<br>
Light had started the cycle one day as usual, but never got his happiness ruined. He had lost track of time, but knew something was off.<br>
Light went looking for Darkness, finding him in a cave.<br>
“Why didn't you follow me?” Light asked. With the sudden noise, Darkness looked up and replied, “I don't enjoy ruining your happiness anymore.” “It makes me feel guilty.” Darkness added.<br>
“I don't know what that means.” Said Light. After Darkness explained the emotion, Light started to feel bad as well, unknowingly creating empathy and sympathy.<br>
Thinking back to how lonely Light had felt when it was walking in an endless array of happiness, Light did not want that again. “Well, if you stop appearing then how will I appreciate my happiness?” Light asked, creating worry. <br>
After a while of thinking Darkness agreed to continue following Light. “You promise? You`ll always follow me? No matter how far I go, right?” Light asked. “I will continue following you until I cannot any longer.” Darkness replied. The two of them created trust in that moment.<br>
Then Light left and Darkness, not wanting to fail his new companion, followed.<br>
Eventually, they continued creating things that would keep them company. However, everything they created had an expiration date. Like when Light created grass, it had died after a few cycles. Light did find that the things he created were aided by the things that Darkness created. Like when Darkness had created rain, it helped his creations live longer. Light, not affected by time, kept experimenting. Much like themselves though, the creations that they each made could not stay in the same place for too long or they would start to wither away. Light created flowers that would grow when watered with Darkness`s rain, but if it rained for too long, Light`s flowers would drown. Light would always stop and tell Darkness of his discoveries. Darkness enjoyed these conversations. He found himself becoming warmer, allowing Light to stay with Darkness for a little bit longer. But Light would always have to go. After all, creation and destruction cannot occupy the same space, they must follow each other. Over time they created a bond similar to love. Because of this love, the guilt Darkness felt became stronger.. Darkness never stopped the cycle though. He continued tearing himself apart. Darkness saw this as a small price to pay for Light’s happiness. This cycle continued on forever, creating Night and Day. This story is the origin of our world. Darkness’s guilt is said to be the reason why we feel guilt and sadness primarily at night. Their love Is said to be the reason why we sleep at night, not wanting to miss the day. And the time that Darkness created in order to spend time with Light, became twilight.” I finished off the story going to leave the room.<br>
“Wait! What happened to their love?” Before I left the room, I responded. “It’s always a bit tragic really. The love stories with no real ending.”
